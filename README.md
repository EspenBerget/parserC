# Parser Combinators

## About
This is a small project I made to learn about parser cominators, TypeScript, and testing in TypeScript.

The library works fine, but writing recursive parsers does not. This is downside considering that parser combinators are a class of parsers known as **recursive** descent parsers.

Still I learn a lot about TypeScript's type system, and testing in TypeScript.

## Warning
This is only a toy project, see [parzec](https://github.com/johtela/parzec) for a proper implementation.


## Sources
This project was mostly inspired by Scott Wlaschin's blog post [Understanding Parser Combinators](https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/parser/).

Alternatively if this interested you, read [this paper](http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszgmh/monparsing.pdf).
